Understood. Based on the snippets you pasted (and the fact that `cargo test` is green), here’s what I would do as a **standalone SlopChop polish pass**—focused on removing Roadmap-era residue, reducing conceptual drift, and keeping the repo lean.

---

## 1) `wizard.rs`: keep or delete?

### What it is

`wizard.rs` is a **pure config initializer**. It does not smell like Roadmap at all—it’s just interactive “create slopchop.toml” UX.

### Why it may not belong anymore (lean/mean criteria)

* You already have “run `slopchop` once and it generates config if missing.” That makes the wizard **redundant**.
* It pulls in “vibes UX” (emoji + colored output). Not wrong, but it’s surface area + dependency weight (`colored`).
* It adds a CLI shape you have to support forever.

### Recommendation

**Delete it unless you can justify it as a permanent UX surface.**

If the default behavior is already:

* `slopchop` generates `slopchop.toml` when missing

…then the wizard is extra. For “lean and mean,” I would remove:

* `src/wizard.rs`
* any CLI subcommand wiring that calls it
* the `colored` dependency if it’s only used here

**Exception:** keep it only if you strongly value interactive setup for non-devs *and* it’s a stable, intended feature. Otherwise it’s just one more thing to go stale.

---

## 2) `audit/enhance.rs`: keep, but reframe output

### What it is

This file does not mutate the repo. It:

* reads source files
* parses via tree-sitter
* emits **a string plan** for some opportunities (high confidence dupes)

So it’s “informational,” consistent with “audit is optional.”

### What’s questionable (standalone / boundary hygiene)

Not the code; it’s the *product semantics*:

* “Enhance opportunities”
* “refactoring plans”
* “GOD TIER PLAN” output elsewhere

This reads like a “next steps / planning” system—which is Roadmap-ish in tone, even if not in mechanics.

### Recommendation

Keep the feature, but change semantics so it cannot be mistaken for Roadmap:

* Rename “enhance” terminology in the UI/output:

  * “refactoring plan” → “suggested consolidation sketch”
  * “god tier plan” → “example refactor outline” (or kill the label entirely)
* Ensure audit remains explicitly **non-authoritative**:

  * no “do this next”
  * no implied workflow coupling

**Code-level:** `enhance_opportunities` currently ignores `_config`. That’s a small smell; either use config (limit, strictness, language allowlist) or remove the parameter.

---

## 3) Tests: rename Roadmap-flavored names now

Your pasted tests (`unit_graph.rs`, `integration_core.rs`, `unit_analysis.rs`) are all fine and not Roadmap-y.

But your earlier run shows this exists:

* `tests/unit_tui.rs` includes `test_roadmap_explorer`

That is exactly the kind of “stale narrative” that causes future confusion.

### Recommendation

Rename tests to reflect what they actually verify:

* `test_roadmap_explorer` → something truthful like:

  * `test_tui_navigation`
  * `test_dashboard_navigation`
  * `test_tui_tab_switching`

Same for any “dashboard” tests that imply roadmap semantics.

This costs almost nothing and removes conceptual debt.

---

## 4) TUI/dashboard: decide if it’s a first-class feature or optional dev tooling

Your repo map shows:

* `src/tui/dashboard/*`
* `src/tui/config/*`
* `src/tui/view/*`

This is not Roadmap-specific by itself, but it *can* hide Roadmap-era UX assumptions (tabs, labels, “explorer,” etc.).

### Two clean options (pick one)

**Option A (leanest):** keep TUI but strip Roadmap semantics.

* Remove/rename any Roadmap tabs/views
* Ensure it only shows:

  * apply status
  * check status
  * config viewer/editor
  * logs

**Option B (lean/mean extreme):** make TUI feature-gated (compile-time feature) or remove it entirely.

* If your core is CLI-first and you want to finalize SlopChop fast, TUI is a classic “nice but distracting” subsystem.

Given your current focus (staged apply + protocol hardening + minimal typing), **I would not expand the TUI right now**, but I would at least remove Roadmap language from it.

---

## 5) Git residue: remove aggressively

Even after you “decoupled Git,” your audit output still shows:

* `src/apply/git.rs`
* functions: `commit_only`, `commit_and_push`
* enum: `GitMode` (in the audit enum cluster list)
* tests mention: `test_git_only`, `test_no_git`

That is your biggest remaining “suite-era” residue, and it *will* keep reappearing unless removed.

### Recommendation

* Delete `src/apply/git.rs`
* Remove `GitMode` and any CLI flags/config keys that mention git
* Update tests accordingly (delete or rewrite git-related tests)

This is a real “standalone” boundary: SlopChop is a filesystem transaction engine; git is external.

---

## 6) Practical “find remaining Roadmap words” on Windows (since `rg` isn’t installed)

Use PowerShell:

```powershell
Select-String -Path src\**\*.rs,tests\**\*.rs -Pattern "roadmap|Roadmap|tasks\.toml|roadmap_v2" -CaseSensitive:$false
```

Or built-in `findstr`:

```bat
findstr /S /I /N "roadmap roadmap_v2 tasks.toml" src\*.rs src\*\*.rs tests\*.rs tests\*\*.rs
```

Whatever hits you get: either delete or rename to truthful terminology.

## 7) About `slopchop audit` suggestions

You were right to treat it carefully. Most of those “20 similar functions” suggestions are **not** obvious wins right now; they’re refactor bait.

The only audit suggestions I would consider “obvious wins” at this stage are:

* **single-file test dedup** (safe, doesn’t affect product behavior)
* **git removal** (aligned with your pivot)
* **Roadmap naming cleanup** (clarity)

I would *not* attempt the large “extract common module” consolidations until your stage/apply pivot is complete, because they increase coupling and churn.

---

## The minimal “standalone polish” checklist

1. Delete `src/roadmap_v2/` entirely.
2. Remove Git modules/types/config/tests (`apply/git.rs`, `GitMode`, git flags, git-only pack/test paths).
3. Rename Roadmap-flavored test names and TUI labels (anything “roadmap explorer”).
4. Decide on `wizard.rs`:

   * default: delete it (redundant; dependency weight)
   * keep only if it’s truly a permanent UX feature
5. Tone cleanup in audit output:

   * remove “god tier” framing
   * make all audit output informational

If you paste `tests/unit_tui.rs` (or just the parts around `test_roadmap_explorer`) and the CLI args/subcommands list from `src/cli/args.rs`, I can tell you exactly which commands/flags/modules are still carrying Roadmap/Git-era semantics and what to delete/rename with minimal churn.
